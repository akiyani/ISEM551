My name is Adeel Kiyani and this is my first Masters and last semester as well. I am local to Harrisburg and work as a Project Manager with the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission's Geoanalytics department. 

I don't have a technical background but am interested in understanding and developing my knowledge base around Java, .NET and learn how Web technologies work and learn how to better understand and manage my stakeholders.

I look forward to meeting with you and other students and take advantage of Professor Allu's experience and knowledge.
